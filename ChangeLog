2012-05-15	version 1.1.0

  * add replace\_by\_median\_value! for replacing missing value with feature median value
  * add replace\_by\_knn\_value! for replacing missing value with weighted feature value from k-nearest neighbors
  * replace\_by\_mean\_value! and replace\_by\_median\_value! now support both column and row mode
  * add EnsembleSingle class for ensemble feature selection by creating an ensemble of feature selectors using a single feature selection algorithm
  * rename Ensemble to EnsembleMultiple for ensemble feature selection by creating an ensemble of feature selectors using multiple feature selection algorithms of the same type
  * bug fix in FileIO module
  
2012-05-08	version 1.0.1

  * modify Ensemble module so that ensemble\_by\_score() and ensemble\_by\_rank() now take Symbol, instead of Method, as argument. This allows easier and clearer function call
  * enable select_feature! interface in Ensemble module for the type of subset selection algorithms
  
2012-05-04	version 1.0.0

  * add new algorithm INTERACT for discrete feature
  * add Consistency module to deal with data inconsistency calculation, which bases on a Hash table and is efficient in both storage and speed
  * update the Chi2 algorithm to try to reproduce the results of the original Chi2 algorithm
  * update documentation whenever necessary
  
2012-04-25	version 0.9.0

  * add new discretization algorithm (Three-Interval Discretization, TID)
  * add new algorithm Las Vegas Filter (LVF) for discrete feature
  * add new algorithm Las Vegas Incremental (LVI) for discrete feature
  
2012-04-23	version 0.8.1

  * correct a bug in the example in the README file because discretize\_by\_ChiMerge!() now takes confidence alpha value as argument instead of chi-square value
  
2012-04-23	version 0.8.0

  * add new algorithm FTest (FT) for continuous feature
  * add .yardoc_opts to gem to use the MarkDown documentation syntax

  * update to version 0.7.0

2012-04-19	Tiejun Cheng	<need47@gmail.com>

  * add new algorithm BetweenWithinClassesSumOfSquare (BSS_WSS) for continuous feature
  * add new algorithm WilcoxonRankSum (WRS) for continuous feature

  * require the RinRuby gem (http://rinruby.ddahl.org) to access the 
    statistical routines in the R package (http://www.r-project.org/)
    
  * because of RinRuby (and thus R), removed the following modules or implementations:
    RubyStats (FishersExactTest.calculate, get_icdf) and ChiSquareCalculator
